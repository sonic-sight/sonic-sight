## Overview

This project is an attempt to make echolocation more accessible 
by using a device that virtually slows down the sound.

The main component of the project is an application that can be deployed
on a Raspberry Pi 3 and can compute the echo response of the environment 
using the data from a depth vision camera. 
The echo is similar as it would be heard if the camera would be a speaker emitting beeps, 
the camera had ears on both sides __and the sound would travell 100x slower__.

The slowdown makes the phenomena easier to comprehend.

You can find some examples on [the project's website](http://sonic-sight.org/examples.html).

## Known limitations

1. Thoroughly __untested__.
2. The depth vision camera is not always accurate (intense light makes it unreliable)
